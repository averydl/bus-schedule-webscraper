# Bus Schedule WebScraper

## Overview

The _WebScraper.java_ file contains a main method that, upon execution, will download the HTML content from the community transit website and use regular expressions to extract the bus route information based on user input.

After listing the routes starting with the letter specified by the user, the program will proceed to prompt the user for a specific bus route and then download/parse the HTML for the specified bus route and list its destination(s) and stops/stop numbers.

## execution
From the command line, this program can be compiled with the javac command, and executed by entering _java WebScraper_ after compilation of both source files.
